# Lock Screen
Non Root Screen locker.  
  

Lock your phone with an independ opensource lock screen without root privileges.  
  

Default pin is 1234. 
  

## IMPORTANT  
**IF THERE IS A BUG ON THE CODE YOU CAN BE LOCKED OUT OF YOUR PHONE!** 

Test the app using the version that includes the crash button, so you are less likely to get locked out of the phone if there is any GUI bug.  
  
If everything works fine, then install the non crash button version. Be very carefull cuz you can get locked out of your phone. If you do, you need to connect to a PC and uninstall the apk or do a factory reset.
  
**If you forget your pin, you will be locked out of your phone too**  
  
There is no backdoors or master PIN. So i will be unable to help you if you change the PIN
